# Student Info: (ID, Name, Major)
student_record = (101, "Alice Wonderland", "Computer Science")

# Solve the TODOs by writing code, NOT by changing the data structure by hand!

# TODO 1: Access and print the student's name.
# TODO 2: Create a new tuple that includes the student's year (e.g., 3 for Junior).
#          Remember, tuples are immutable, so you'll create a NEW one.
#          Hint: You can concatenate tuples using '+'
# TODO 3: Unpack the original student_record into three separate variables.
