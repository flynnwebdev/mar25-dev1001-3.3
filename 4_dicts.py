# Solve the TODOs by writing code, NOT by changing the data structure by hand!

# TODO 1: The price increased by $50. Update it.
# TODO 2: Add a new key-value pair: "brand": "TechCo".
# TODO 3: Check if "warranty_years" is a key. If not, add it with a value of 2.
#           Use .get() for checking initially.
# TODO 4: Someone bought a laptop. Decrease stock by 1.
# TODO 5: Print all key-value pairs neatly.
